### Advanced Data Mining:
1. Evaluating bounds of Euclidean and Manhattan distances for n, d-dimensional arrays (n ranges from 100 to 1000 and d ranges from 1 to 100).
2. Regularized Linear models (both Lasso and Ridge implementations), as well as Spectral Clustering implementation with Networkx, as well as Linear Algebra computations of the Adjacency matrix, diagonal degree matrix, Laplacian matrix, as well as the Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors. K-means run on 2 clusters.
