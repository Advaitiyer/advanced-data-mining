### Advanced Data Mining:
1. HW1: Evaluating bounds of Euclidean and Manhattan distances for n d-dimensional arrays.
2. HW2: Text clustering using k-means with eigenvalue decomposition.
3. HW3: Regularized Linear models (both Lasso and Ridge implementations), as well as Spectral Clustering implementation with Networkx.
4. HW4: Implementation of Flajolet Martin algorithm for counting highest trailing zeros; Bloom Filter for spam detection; MapReduce for Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH); Jaccard Similarity between k-shingles.
5. Project: Network analysis of Amazon's co-purchased products (Stanford Network Analysis Library).
