### Advanced Data Mining:
1. Evaluating bounds of Euclidean and Manhattan distances for n d-dimensional arrays.
2. Text clustering using k-means with eigenvalue decomposition.
3. Regularized Linear models (both Lasso and Ridge implementations), as well as Spectral Clustering implementation with Networkx.
4. Project: Network analysis of Amazon's co-purchased products (Stanford Network Analysis Library).
