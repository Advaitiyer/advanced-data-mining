## Top words and k-means clustering algorithm implementation.

**Description:** Large text file is clustered into 10 different clusters after top 500 words are identified.

### 1. Pre-processing

Cleaned continuous text by splitting it into sentences, removing "\n", and headers.

### 2. Top-words

Built dictionary of words and sorted them in descending order. Identified top 500 words.

### 3. Vectorization

### 4. k-Means Clustering

For k=10, performed k-means using Scikit-learn.
